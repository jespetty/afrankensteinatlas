<h1>HGIS/Literary Analysis Essay</h1>
<h2>Research Question: How does the length of time that characters spend in locations correlate to their actions in the novel? 
</h2>
<p>
    There are several points throughout the novel where illnesses and life events force Victor Frankenstein to stay in certain places for long periods of time. To a critical reader, this may seem pointless. For example, he spends several months gathering courage to create a female monster even after he has agreed to do it. Similarly, when the monster is first created and he runs away, Frankenstein spends a long time in the care of his friend, too sick to leave his apartment. What purpose could this serve in the plot? Over how long a period of time does the novel take place? Does the length of time spent in a certain location correlate to the motivation of the characters, whether positive or negative? I am hoping to examine this through a graphical representation of the periods of time against the geographical location. This may turn into a timeline-type essay rather than mapping, but I want to use maps.
